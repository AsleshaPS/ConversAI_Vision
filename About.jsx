          <h2>Common PCB Defects</h2>
          <p>Open: A broken or incomplete electrical connection that prevents current flow.</p>
          <p>Short: An unintended connection between two or more traces, causing a short circuit.</p>
          <p>Mousebite: Small, disconnected copper islands or "bites" left during the PCB etching process.</p>
          <p>Spur: Extra or unintended copper extensions that can interfere with the circuitâ€™s operation.</p>
          <p>Pin Hole: Tiny, unintentional holes in the solder mask or PCB that can lead to moisture ingress and corrosion.</p>
          <p>Spurious Copper: Unwanted copper areas on the PCB that can cause electrical noise or short circuits.</p>
